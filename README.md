## What is DeepSee?

Deep ocean researchers can now access 2D topographic maps and color photomosaics of the seafloor, allowing for the relation of point-source seafloor sample collections (e.g. sediment cores, rock, animal, and water samples) with their appropriate environmental context at centimeter to kilometer spatial scales.
However, while 2D maps of spatial locations of samples are valuable, the field currently lacks visualization tools which extend into the 3rd dimension, i.e. within the subseafloor.

DeepSee is an interactive workspace for scientists to upload sediment core data and map images and see their sampling history displayed across multiple connected views simultaneously.
Interactive maps of the seafloor between centimeter and kilometer resolution are labeled with information about previous dives as well as collected samples.
Alongside these maps, DeepSee displays 2D visualizations that show parameter gradients as a function of depth and interactive 3D visualizations of data interpolations in the space between samples.
The data interpolations can be run in real time, allowing scientists to "see" below the seafloor and determine the most likely places to collect high-value samples.
To support decision making, DeepSee provides annotation tools on the maps for taking notes, useful for communicating findings and planning future dives.
Finally, DeepSee is portable and requires no internet access, empowering scientists to use DeepSee on field expeditions in remote environments.

## Getting Started

‚úÖ You can try DeepSee locally on your own computer by downloading it as pre-built software!

### Windows

- Download DeepSee for Windows here: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/deepsee/files/v0.1.0/deepsee.win.zip/download>

- Run DeepSee:

  1. Unzip the files to a new folder (e.g., named `DeepSee`)
  2. Inside the folder should be `DeepSee.exe`. Double-click that to run the visualizations interface
  3. Inside the folder should also be `interpolations.exe`. Double-click that to start the interpolations server

- If you want to modify the data that DeepSee uses:

  1. Inside the folder navigate to `resources\assets\`
  2. Read the documentation for each of the sub-directories
  3. After you make changes to the data, simply reload the tool (e.g., in the open tool window, press `CTRL+SHIFT+R`)

### MacOS / Linux

- Download DeepSee for MacOS/Linux here: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/deepsee/files/v0.1.0/deepsee.mac.zip/download>

- Run DeepSee:

  1. Unzip the files to a new folder (e.g., named `DeepSee`)
  2. Inside the folder should be `DeepSee.app`. Double-click that to run the visualizations interface
  3. Inside the folder should also be `interpolations`. Double-click that to start the interpolations server

- If you want to modify the data that DeepSee uses:

  1. Right-click on `DeepSee.app` and select `Show Package Contents`
  2. Navigate to `Contents/Resources/assets/`
  3. Read the documentation for each of the sub-directories
  4. After you make changes to the data, simply reload the tool (e.g., in the open tool window, press `COMMAND+SHIFT+R`)

## Development

üå± If you want to customize DeepSee for your own project, start here!

- Install Node.js `v16.x` and npm `v7.x` by visiting ([release](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Install Python `v3.9.x` ([latest release](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/))
- Clone this repo to your computer ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))

```bash
git clone git@github.com:orphanlab/DeepSee.git

# use --depth if you don't want to download the whole commit history
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:orphanlab/DeepSee.git
```

### Interface

- A frontend Vue.js v2 app to visualize data in the browser.
- Additional details can be found in [interface/README.md](https://github.com/orphanlab/DeepSee/blob/main/interface/README.md)
- To upload your own data, see [interface/public/assets/README.md](https://github.com/orphanlab/DeepSee/blob/main/interface/public/assets/README.md)

Navigate to the interface folder:

```bash
cd interface
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run DeepSee:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). You should see DeepSee running in your browser :)

### Server

- A backend Python 3.9 Flask web app to process interpolations in the background
- Additional details can be found in [deepsee/server/README.md](https://github.com/orphanlab/DeepSee/blob/main/server/README.md)

Navigate to the server folder:

```bash
cd server
```

Install dependencies:

- If you are running Windows:

```bash
# Start a virtual environment
py -3.9 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements-win.txt
```

- If you are running MacOS / Linux:

```bash
# Start a virtual environment
python3.9 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements-mac.txt
```

Then run the server:

```bash
python app.py
```
